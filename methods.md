## Generalized k-means algorithm for microstate analysis

This page gives a detailed description of the methods of the generalized k-means clustering algorithm for cortical and sensor-space M/EEG microstate analysis. This page is largely based on the Supplementary Material of Tait and Zhang (2021) bioRxiv 2021.03.25.436979. doi: [10.1101/2021.03.25.436979](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.25.436979).
